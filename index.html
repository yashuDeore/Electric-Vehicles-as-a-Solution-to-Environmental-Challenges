			<h1>Introduction to Electric Vehicles</h1>
			<p>An electric vehicle (EV) is a vehicle that uses one or more electric motors for propulsion. The vehicle can be powered by a collector system, with electricity from extravehicular sources, or can be powered autonomously by a battery or by converting fuel to electricity using a generator or fuel cells. EVs include road and rail vehicles, electric boats and underwater vessels, electric aircraft and electric spacecraft.</p>

				Environmental Challenges of Fossil Fuel Vehicles
			</h1>

			
			<p>
				Petrol and diesel are both made from oil - a black, gloopy substance formed from the fossilised remains of animal and plant life that lived and died under our oceans hundreds of millions of years ago.  Oil contains compounds of carbon and when it’s burned in a car’s engine, along with being an energy source, it produces carbon dioxide (CO2), the most abundant ‘greenhouse gas’ in our planet’s atmosphere.  The concentration of CO2 in our planet’s atmosphere has been increasing rapidly in recent years, and now stands at over 400 parts per million, while in 1800, it was at just below 283 ppm.  The increased level of CO2 in our atmosphere, brought about by increased burning of fossil fuels, is now agreed by almost all climate scientists to be the cause of rapidly accelerating climate change and rising global average temperatures.

				Benefits of Electric Vehicles
			</h1>

			
			<p>
				Transport is a fundamental requirement of modern life, but the traditional combustion engine is quickly becoming outdated. Petrol or diesel vehicles are highly polluting and are being quickly replaced by fully electric vehicles. Fully electric vehicles (EV) have zero tailpipe emissions and are much better for the environment. The electric vehicle revolution is here, and you can be part of it. Will your next vehicle be an electric one?

					Lower running costs
				</h1>

				
				<p>
					

The running cost of an electric vehicle is much lower than an equivalent petrol or diesel vehicle. Electric vehicles use electricity to charge their batteries instead of using fossil fuels like petrol or diesel. Electric vehicles are more efficient, and that combined with the electricity cost means that charging an electric vehicle is cheaper than filling petrol or diesel for your travel requirements. Using renewable energy sources can make the use of electric vehicles more eco-friendly. The electricity cost can be reduced further if charging is done with the help of renewable energy sources installed at home, such as solar panels.

				<h1>
					Low maintenance cost
				</h1>

				
				<p>
Electric vehicles have very low maintenance costs because they don’t have as many moving parts as an internal combustion vehicle. The servicing requirements for electric vehicles are lesser than the conventional petrol or diesel vehicles. Therefore, the yearly cost of running an electric vehicle is significantly low.

				<p>
Driving an electric vehicle can help you reduce your carbon footprint because there will be zero tailpipe emissions. You can reduce the environmental impact of charging your vehicle further by choosing renewable energy options for home electricity.

				<p>
Registration fees and road tax on purchasing electric vehicles are lesser than petrol or diesel vehicles. There are multiple policies and incentives offered by the government depending on which state you are in. To find out more about electric vehicle incentives, click below .

					Petrol and diesel use is destroying our planet
				</h1>

				
				<p>
The availability of fossil fuels is limited, and their use is destroying our planet. Toxic emissions from petrol and diesel vehicles lead to long-term, adverse effects on public health. The emissions impact of electric vehicles is much lower than petrol or diesel vehicles. From an efficiency perspective, electric vehicles can covert around 60% of the electrical energy from the grid to power the wheels, but petrol or diesel cars can only convert 17%-21% of the energy stored in the fuel to the wheels. That is a waste of around 80%. Fully electric vehicles have zero tailpipe emissions, but even when electricity production is taken into account, petrol or diesel vehicles emit almost 3 times more carbon dioxide than the average EV. To reduce the impact of charging electric vehicles, India is ambitious to achieve about 40 percent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by the year 2030. Therefore, electric vehicles are the way forward for Indian transport, and we must switch to them now.
