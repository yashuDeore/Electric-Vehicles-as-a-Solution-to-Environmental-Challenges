				<b>Electric Vehicles</b>
			    Electric vehicles have been used for the past two hundred years, with several prototypes developed in the late-1800s, but not until the 2000s were highway-ready options available at widespread locations around the world. However, due to limited storage capacity in batteries and improvements in the internal combustion engines, attention for electric vehicles decreased. In the 1970s, oil crisis led to renewed interest in electric vehicles (Pollet et al., 2012)

				<b>Electric Vehicles: Benefits, Challenges, and Potential Solutions for Widespread Adaptation </b> TThe world’s primary modes of transportation are facing two major problems: rising oil costs and increasing carbon emissions. As a result, electric vehicles (EVs) are gaining popularity as they are independent of oil and do not produce greenhouse gases. However, despite their benefits, several operational issues still need to be addressed for EV adoption to become widespread. This research delves into the evolution of EVs over time and highlights their benefits, including reducing carbon emissions and air pollution.

				<b>The great electric car race
is just beginning:</b> On the southern edge of Brussels, where the city turns to suburbs, the future of Germany’s most successful automaker is taking shape inside a peculiar sort of car factory. Here, there are no exhaust pipes, transmissions or fuel tanks. There are no spark plugs, radiators or manifolds. What the Volkswagen Group factory does have, however, are batteries stacked to the rafters.

				<b>Charging into the future: the transition to electric vehicles:</b>Ready to charge into the future? The market for electric vehicles (EVs) has grown rapidly in recent years and is expected to continue to grow at a fast pace over the coming decade. Electric car sales in the United States increased from a mere 0.2 percent of total car sales in 2011 to 4.6 percent in 2021.
